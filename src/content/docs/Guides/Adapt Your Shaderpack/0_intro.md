The objective of this tutorial is to adapt an already existing shaderpack and make it compatible with Colorwheel.

:::caution[Warning]
**This tutorial is intended for experienced shaderpack developers.**
:::

### Prerequisites

Assuming you are already a shader developer with a working development setup:

- A computer supporting OpenGL 3.3.
- A shaderpack compatible with Iris.  
- An instance of Minecraft with Iris, Colorwheel and mod(s) providing Flywheel >= 1.0.  
[Vanillin](https://modrinth.com/mod/flw-vanillin/) and [Create](modrinth.com/mod/create/) will be used for this tutorial.  

:::note
The [shaderpack](https://github.com/IrisShaders/tutorial-code/tree/main/Your%20First%20Shader/5.%20Fog) from the Iris tutorial will be used for reference. You may find the sources on [GitHub]().
