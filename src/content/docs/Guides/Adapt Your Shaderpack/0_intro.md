The objective of this tutorial is to adapt an already existing shaderpack and make it compatible with Colorwheel.

:::caution[Warning]
**This tutorial is intended for experienced shaderpack developers.** If you do not have experience in writing a shaderpack, you will likely struggle.
:::

### Prerequisites

Assuming you are already a shader developer with a working development setup:

- A computer supporting OpenGL 3.3.
- A shaderpack compatible with Iris with **gbuffers_block** and **shadow** programs.  
While these programs are not required for Colorwheel compatibility, they serve as solid foundation for building Colorwheel programs.
- An instance of Minecraft with Iris, Colorwheel and mod(s) providing Flywheel >= 1.0 are required.  
[Vanillin](https://modrinth.com/mod/flw-vanillin/) and [Create](modrinth.com/mod/create/) will be used for this tutorial.
